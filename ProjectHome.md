[Local outlier factor (LOF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_outlier_factor) is an anomaly detection algorithm presented as "LOF: Identifying Density-based Local Outliers" by Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng and Jörg Sander. The key idea of LOF is comparing the local density of a point's neighborhood with the local density of its neighbors.

This project will implement the algorithm and its extensions in Java. Stay tuned.
